Additionally sensitive operations like ordering money transfer must be signed with the private key. Further infromation on a topic of authentication and authorisation may be found in [dedicated section](#section/Usage/Authentication).\r\n    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.\r\n    All requests must use TLS 1.1 or above.\r\n\r\n    ## Getting started\r\n\r\n    ### Samples\r\n\r\n    Check for sample code demonstrating usage of Walutomat API in [this Github repository](https://github.com/Currency-One/api-examples)\r\n\r\n    ### Sandbox\r\n\r\n    We prepared sandbox to ease integration with Walutomat.\r\n    Developers may learn Walutomat API and test integration even before business arrangments are finalized.\r\n    Sandbox is best place to test changes first as well.\r\n    Sandbox URL: `walutomat.dev`\r\n    To request sandbox account, please contact us: api@walutomat.pl\r\n\r\n    ### First steps\r\n\r\n    Follow this simple step-by-step guide to get started using the Walutomat API.\r\n\r\n    #### Generate your public/private key pair\r\n\r\n    Generate a pair of RSA keys with key size of 4096 bits, here are examples for different operating systems:\r\n\r\n    For Linux:\r\n    ```sh\r\n    $ openssl genrsa -out ./private.key 4096\r\n    $ openssl rsa -in ./private.key -pubout -out ./public.key\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    For Windows:\r\n    - Download and install PuTTY,\r\n    - Use PuTTYgen to generate RSA key, make sure you change \"Number of bits in a generated key\" to 4096,\r\n    - After key is generated in \"Actions\" section, click \"Save public key\", as it saves key in RSA PEM format,\r\n    - \"Save private key\" as well and store it somewhere.\r\n\r\n    Generated key should look as follows:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n    MIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAg8AMIICCgKCAgEAucK1TudLBMAF0GjGII6h\r\n    25k1kh0MBCNjNnVBWyOwc06ivr1Xg5U4EBXJqi4HQowhcOKHNVusL1KgsbRqwNvR\r\n    fGwXUgfp9CNeeKKZrgo98+0hUcR+wrR59F2dSnoQ4CWUHuUk5Tinj7mh2+uzu5BF\r\n    mJefy5d1Mj81ANbpwwETeo/OSK+3++h0ac+kfdokE57CjurnD3b5AMnQ6RLtZm2O\r\n    GnEtwWymxXLO84tdRYo/e/Rbg9/yTmDhpTDcexJDd1f5O6814BxL4TFe/6AnFa2y\r\n    nm+Ot9Sxa01OOEzHDQW6CK3x5BbH3rv6/5UAKoliWyTUcyDvIlikiO0eQPlHk/YP\r\n    W0dYGqFlSkdc8xDJByhiDZWZlnNUrKiLaJw/O6oybqme9+NnghiuQ8Ck3VO8ESpJ\r\n    Q90TV3Ffl+TkWoULKF/9iK37szwV57ogafgX0YimN+qkQjLPr/9s/PQxDLxd/JKq\r\n    WM4MTEkNxsE9Cw5r76Xkex3Z6X0YF89UryjFIuTi2+U5yow6gF6uBKcD2tYzMmdx\r\n    orCRtNSUrueH56+c7axDtIdoX0GGvCWIDT343I96Di2ZDKo8Lxx11vTNjLokJaDj\r\n    IQz12YrqNnKtAjqmDO+Y4mAU7qbFgiBGIT7R1JLoemiNhLf7UdX9g1/0AOyGvDxp\r\n    Pe62GHE5pTQ74mf5jxWseskCAwEAAQ==\r\n    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    #### Upload your public RSA key and reveal your API key\r\n\r\n    1. Log into the Walutomat User Panel - [live production](https://user.walutomat.pl) or [sandbox environment](https://user.walutomat.dev) accordingly\r\n    2. Go to section \"API Key\" (contact our support center if there is no API Key section in the main menu)\r\n    3. Using \"Your API Keys v.2\" section, add new key and paste the content of the `public.key` file\r\n    4. Store the API key in a safe place. You will be able to view it later in the User Panel using additional authentication.\r\n\r\n    ### Simple API usage scenario\r\n    Now, as you have Walutomat API activated, your API key generated and probably your public key uploaded in the user panel, you can try first calls to API endpoints.\r\n    We suggest you to try example provided below.\r\n    Please note you may use sandbox for first trials (recommended). If this is the case, please change production URL `api.walutomat.pl` to sandbox `api.walutomat.dev` in samples below.\r\n\r\n\r\n    #### Example, step 1: learn current exchange rate\r\n\r\n    1. Replace `API_KEY` and `path/to/private.key` in the command below\r\n    2. Query the following endpoint to learn current exchange rate offered by Currency One\r\n    3. You should see the exchange rate in the response; note down the `ts` attribute of the response, you will need it in the next step.\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    $ timestamp=$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")\r\n    $ endpoint=\"/api/v2.0.0/direct_fx/rates?currencyPair=EURPLN\"\r\n    $ body=\"\"\r\n    $ signature=$(echo -n \"$timestamp$endpoint$body\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign /path/to/private.key | openssl enc -A -base64)\r\n    $ curl -i \\\r\n      -H \"X-API-Key: API_KEY\" \\\r\n      -H \"X-API-Signature: $signature\" \\\r\n      -H \"X-API-Timestamp: $timestamp\" \\\r\n      -X GET \"https://api.walutomat.pl$endpoint\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    > Example response:\r\n\r\n    ```json\r\n     {\r\n        \"success\": true,\r\n        \"result\": {\r\n          \"ts\": \"2018-03-27T09:58:06.945Z\",\r\n          \"currencyPair\": \"EURPLN\",\r\n          \"buyRate\": \"4.1234\",\r\n          \"sellRate\": \"4.0987\"\r\n        }\r\n     }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    #### Example, step 2: order currency exchange\r\n\r\n    Knowing current exchange rate you are now ready to order currency exchange accepting received exchange rate. Notice the `dryRun` flag. Set `dryRun=true` to test the action (no actual exchange would take place).\r\n\r\n    1. Use the command below replacing `API_KEY` and `/path/to/private.key`\r\n    2. Replace `exchange_rate_ts` with the `ts` from the previous step.\r\n\r\n    ```sh\r\n    $ timestamp=$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")\r\n    $ endpoint=\"/api/v2.0.0/direct_fx/exchanges\"\r\n    $ body=\"dryRun=false&submitId=93a68f4d-ce40-40be-adac-3bb4d4b5e392&currencyPair=EURPLN&buySell=BUY&volume=999.00&volumeCurrency=EUR&ts=exchange_rate_ts\"\r\n    $ signature=$(echo -n \"$timestamp$endpoint$body\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign /path/to/private.key | openssl enc -A -base64)\r\n    $ curl -i \\\r\n      -d \"$body\" \\\r\n      -H \"X-API-Key: API_KEY\" \\\r\n      -H \"X-API-Signature: $signature\" \\\r\n      -H \"X-API-Timestamp: $timestamp\" \\\r\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\r\n      -X POST \"https://api.walutomat.pl$endpoint\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    > Example response:\r\n\r\n    ```json\r\n      {\r\n        \"success\": true,\r\n        \"duplicate\": false,\r\n        \"result\": {\r\n          \"exchangeId\": \"2607f83b-3a60-4097-912c-72e1cf7a0085\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n    **Note**: There are two models of currency exchange offered by Currency One via API: direct currency exchange with Currency One (endpoints in `direct_fx` namespace), used in this demonstration, and P2P exchange on Walutomat market (endpoints in `market_fx` namespace) - see further sections to learn more about those 2 models and acting on Walutomat market via API.\r\n\r\n    Congratulations! You have performed your first currency exchange with Walutomat API.\r\n\r\n    ### Next steps\r\n\r\n    Now that you have performed your first currency exchange, you can learn more about the rest of the API.\r\n\r\n    #### Learn about direct vs market exchange\r\n\r\n    Currency One offers two types of currency exchange. Learn about the [difference](#section/Overview/Currency-exchange-models) and pick the right one for your system/business.\r\n\r\n    #### Submit new currency exchange order to Walutomat market\r\n\r\n    Now that you have performed your first direct currency exchange with Currency One, you can try the market model of currency exchange by submitting new [exchange order](#operation/newOrder) to Walutomat market. In this scenario Currency One is only platform operator and orders are executed if/when matching opposite order is available on the market.\r\n\r\n    #### Order transfer from Walutomat multicurrency wallet\r\n\r\n    After currency exchange you may want to transfer exchanged currency from Walutomat multicurrency wallet to your bank account or transfer it to third party. This operation can be requested via API as well and you use [transfer](#operation/newTransferIban) endpoint to achieve this.\r\n\r\n    ## Currency exchange models\r\n\r\n    The Walutomat API offers two different currency exchange types: direct and market.\r\n    A direct exchange is standard currency exchange with Currency One and requires to accept exchange rate offered by Currency One. The exchange rate is valid 10 minutes from its publication (publication timestamp is stored in `ts` attribute).\r\n    A market exchange uses Walutomat market, where all participants may submit their currency exchange offers (bids and asks). Walutomat API provides endpoints to act on this market, by learning current best offers available on the market, submitting new exchange order with limit price to Walutomat market, checking order execution (whether and how much of the offered currency were exchanged so far), withdrawing own offers from the market.\r\n    To distinguish API endpoints related to different  currency exchange models, endpoints dedicated to direct exchange with Currency one are located in `direct_fx/` namespace while endpoints dedicated to P2P currency exchange on Walutomat market are located in `market_fx/` namespace.\r\n\r\n    ### Which type of exchange do I need?\r\n\r\n    It depends upon your business model ad your system requirements. Note that in direct exchange model, exchange rate is known a priori and could be freezed up to ten minutes while in market exchange situation on the market changes dynamically. On the other hand, API to Walutomat market allows to design and automate different trading strategies that may perform well and significantly outrank results that would be achieved in direct exchange scenario.\r\n\r\n    ## Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n    The following changes are considered backwards compatible:\r\n    * Adding new API endpoints\r\n    * Adding new properties to the responses from existing API endpoints\r\n    * Adding optional request parameters to existing API endpoints\r\n    * Altering the format or length of IDs\r\n    * Altering the message attributes returned by validation failures or other errors\r\n    * Reordering properties returned from existing API endpoints\r\n\r\n    ## Changelog\r\n\r\n    Release date | Description\r\n    ------------ | -----------\r\n    2022-10-25 | Added endpoint GET /account/history/mt940 for mt940 export statement\r\n    2022-03-21 | Added transferPurpose and sourceOfIncome optional params to /transfer/(non)iban endpoints\r\n    2021-12-13 | Added operationDetailedType parameter to /account/history endpoint\r\n    2021-08-24 | Added endpoint GET /transfer to learn transfer status and details\r\n    2018-XX-XX | Added endpoints to history of operations on multicurrency wallet (payins, payouts, currency exchanges)\r\n    2018-XX-XX | Release API version 2.0.0\r\n\r\n    Documentation for earlier versions - see [v1](https://api.walutomat.pl/v1/)\r\n\r\n    # Usage\r\n\r\n    ## Authentication\r\n\r\n    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Any requests made over HTTP will fail.\r\n    The API uses token-based authentication. You will be provided with a API key which must be included in the header under X-API-Key attributes of all requests made to the API that requires authentication.\r\n    Additionally sensitive requests must be signed with RSA key with key size of 4096 bits and in such cases request signature shall be included in the request header in X-API-Signature attribute. Check specific endpoints documentation to learn given endpoint requirements.\r\n\r\n    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\r\n\r\n    ## Errors\r\n\r\n    Responses contain `success` flag and `error` object.\r\n    If `success` attribute contains `false`, `error` object is not empty and shall be examined to learn error reason and details.\r\n\r\n    ### Error object\r\n\r\n    > Error object example:\r\n\r\n    ```json\r\n     {\r\n        \"success\": false,\r\n        \"errors\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"key\": \"INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS\",\r\n            \"description\": \"Requested payout exceeds current wallet balance {walletBalance}\",\r\n            \"trace\": \"\",\r\n            \"errorData\": [\r\n              {\r\n                \"key\": \"walletBalance\",\r\n                \"value\": \"3.14 EUR\"\r\n              }\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Error object always contains error `key` and error `description` in English. May contain key-value structure `errorData` with additional values that may be referred to in `description`. Error object may contain `trace` information. When unspecified error occurred, the trace can help to track the problem. You may be asked to deliver received response with trace content to our support team.\r\n\r\n\r\n    **Note**: It is assumed that all API endpoints always responds with 200 code and valid json success attribute. No response received or response with other code shall not be treated as confirmation of request rejection. In such cases recommended approach is to repeat request *with unchanged submitId*. See also Duplicates section.\r\n\r\n    ![API response handling diagram](handling_responses.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ## Pagination\r\n\r\n    Requests that return multiple items, e.g. `GET /account/history`, will be paginated to 100 items by default. You can access further items using the `?continueFrom` parameter. You can change default page size with `?volume` parameter. Items could be sorted from the newest created (default) or in reverse order by setting `?sortOrder` parameter to `ASC`.\r\n\r\n    ## Duplicates\r\n\r\n    You can safely repeat submitting requests, especially when you are unsure whether previous attempt reaches Walutomat or you did not manage to process Walutomat API response.\r\n\r\n    **Note**: When repeating request make sure to provide same request id (`submitId`)!\r\n\r\n    When Walutomat API receives request with same `submitId` parameter value again, it will not perform requested operation one more time, but simply repeats last response, this time with `duplicate` attribute set to `true`.\r\n\r\n    ## Testing\r\n\r\n    All requests that may incur charges or otherwise may affect multicurrency wallet balance (like currency exchange, payout) are equipped with `dryRun` parameter. When set to `true` dry run mode is on. In this mode request is just validated but not executed.\r\n\r\n    ### Why use a `dryRun` flag?\r\n\r\n    The key difference, for dryRun requests:\r\n    * requests does not affect money, no operation on multicurrency wallet is performed, no charges are incurred\r\n    * still, requests correctness is validated, possibility to perform request operation is verified and additional information is returned (e.g. the cost tested operation may incur)\r\n\r\n    The main reasons for using dry run are therefore to:\r\n    * Verify your system have network connectivity with the Walutomat API\r\n    * Verify you are posting all the required data in the right format to the Walutomat API\r\n    * Verify you are handling the Walutomat API responses correctly\r\n\r\n    but also to:\r\n    * Verify whether requested operation can be performed (e.g. indicated currencies are supported or IBAN account number is valid)\r\n    * Learn the cost of the operation if it would be requested not in dry run mode (i.e. you can use it to determine payout cost)\r\n\r\nexternalDocs:\r\n  description: Find out more about Walutomat\r\n  url: http://walutomat.pl/en\r\n\r\n\r\nschemes:\r\n - https\r\n\r\nsecurityDefinitions:\r\n  api_key:\r\n    type: apiKey\r\n    name: X-API-Key\r\n    in: header\r\n\r\n######## DOC CHAPTERS ############\r\nx-tagGroups:\r\n  - name: Endpoint reference\r\n    tags:\r\n      - account\r\n      - payout\r\n      - direct_fx\r\n      - market_fx\r\n\r\ntags:\r\n- name: account\r\n  description: Account balance and history\r\n  x-displayName: Account information\r\n\r\n- name: payout\r\n  description: |\r\n    Payout from wallet\r\n\r\n  x-displayName: Payouts\r\n\r\n- name: direct_fx\r\n  description: Exchange currency with Currency One\r\n  x-displayName: Direct FX\r\n\r\n- name: market_fx\r\n  description: Endpoints dedicated to P2P currency exchange at Walutomat stock exchange (managing orders and trace order execution)\r\n  x-displayName: Market (P2P) FX\r\n\r\nbasePath: \"/api/v2.0.0\"\r\n\r\n########## DEFINITIONS #############\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  GenericResponse:\r\n    type: object\r\n    properties:\r\n      success:\r\n        type: boolean\r\n        description: True when exchange request was valid and succesfully handled, if false investigate errors table for details\r\n      errors:\r\n        type: array\r\n        items:\r\n          $ref: '#/definitions/ErrorType'\r\n    required:\r\n      - success\r\n\r\n  ErrorType:\r\n    type: object\r\n    properties:\r\n      key:\r\n        type: string\r\n        description: Error key\r\n        example: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS\r\n        enum:\r\n        - AMOUNT_TOO_SMALL\r\n        - API_DISABLED\r\n        - COUNTRY_NOT_SUPPORTED\r\n        - CURRENCY_NOT_SUPPORTED\r\n        - INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS\r\n        - INVALID_ACCOUNT_NUMBER\r\n        - INVALID_API_KEY\r\n        - INVALID_ARGUMENTS\r\n        - INVALID_SIGNATURE\r\n        - MISSING_API_KEY\r\n        - MISSING_AUTH_ROLE\r\n        - MISSING_PUBLIC_KEY\r\n        - MISSING_SIGNATURE\r\n        - NOT_AUTHORIZED\r\n        - OTHER\r\n        - PAYOUT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED\r\n        - TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND\r\n        - SOURCE_OF_INCOME_REQUIRED\r\n        - PURPOSE_REQUIRED\r\n        - AMOUNT_MUST_BE_INTEGER\r\n      description:\r\n        type: string\r\n        description: Descriptive error message with possible references to errorData entries\r\n        example: Requested payout exceeds current wallet balance {walletBalance}\r\n      errorData:\r\n        type: array\r\n        items:\r\n          $ref: '#/definitions/ErrorData'\r\n    required:\r\n      - key\r\n      - description\r\n      - errorData\r\n\r\n  ErrorData:\r\n    required:\r\n        - key\r\n        - value\r\n    properties:\r\n      key:\r\n        type: string\r\n        description: Error data entry key\r\n        example: walletBalance\r\n      value:\r\n        type: string\r\n        description: Error data entry value\r\n        example: 3.14 EUR\r\n\r\n  DuplicatableResponse:\r\n    type: object\r\n    required:\r\n      - duplicate\r\n    properties:\r\n      duplicate:\r\n        type: boolean\r\n        description: True when submitId was used before, in such a case no new operation like exchange or payout is performed.
